## üîù Most-Used Git Commands in Real Projects

Here are the top four commands that I will likely use the most in real-world projects:

1. **`git pull`** ‚Äì Keeps local copy updated with the latest changes from the remote repository.
2. **`git commit -m`** ‚Äì Saves snapshots of my work with clear messages, making it easier to track progress.
3. **`git push`** ‚Äì Sends local commits to the remote repository, share my work with others.
4. **`git merge`** ‚Äì Allows to combine changes from different branches, essential for team collaboration.

These commands are foundational for managing, updating, and sharing code efficiently in a project.
